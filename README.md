# DATA2060_FinalProject

## Overview

This project is about CART - Classification and Regression Tree for classification. We used the heart disease dataset on kaggle

(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

The goal is to implement CART using only numpy, the accuracy achieved by the scikit-learn model is:, our accuracy is:

More details about the implementation is in the pdf.

## Prerequisites

Dependencies are listed in the yml file. 

Run these two commands in the terminal:

`conda env create -n data2060 -f dependencies.yml`

`conda activate data2060`

For macOS, use `brew install graphviz` to see our decision tree's graph. 

For Ubuntu/Debian, use `sudo apt-get update` followed by `sudo apt-get install graphviz`

You can use `dot -V` to verify the installation.
